# How to contribute

First of all, thanks for reading this and trying to contribute to this repo.

## Testing

As we currently don't have a working unit testing or integrated testing guideline or instance, a full test is recommended before committing, and we still recommend committing with a working unit test.

## Committing

Please fork this repo first, create and commit to your own forked repo's branch, and open a Pull Request that we can review and merge your branch.

Please include a short and precise description about what you have done in the commit message.

We strongly recommend use GPG to sign your commit, and add a sign-off message after your commit message. We enabled vigilant mode so we can make sure that all commits are committed by yourself.

```
$ git commit -s -S -m "what-i-have-done"
```

For now we don't force contributors to sign their commits, but in the future we might refuse Pull Requests that commits are not signed.
